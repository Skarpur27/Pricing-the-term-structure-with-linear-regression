# Replicating and Extending "Pricing the Term Structure with Linear Regression" by Tobias Adrian, Richard Crump, and Emmanuel Moench

## Overview

This repository contains our efforts to replicate and extend the findings of the seminal paper "Pricing the Term Structure with Linear Regression" by Tobias Adriaen, Richard Krempe, and Emmanuel Moensch. Our project aimed to not only replicate the original analysis using the methodologies and data sets described in the paper but also to update the results with more recent data. This endeavor involved a thorough examination of the bond market and its term structure, as outlined in the original study.

## Objectives

Replication: To accurately replicate the results obtained in the original paper, including all data analysis, tables, and graphs.
Extension: To update the analysis with newer data to assess the validity and reliability of the original findings in the current economic context.
Analysis Enhancement: Attempt to enhance the original analysis by incorporating additional data sources or applying updated statistical techniques, if applicable.

## Methodology

The project was conducted by closely following the methodology outlined in the original paper. This included:

Linear regression analysis to price the term structure of bonds.
Replication of the data collection process, using both the original data sources and newer ones to update the dataset.
Detailed comparison of the replicated results with those presented in the original paper.

## Usage

This repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation through the different phases of our replication and extension process. It includes:

Data: Both the original dataset used by Adriaen, Krempe, and Moensch, as well as the updated datasets compiled for this study.
Code: Scripts and notebooks detailing the analysis process, from data preprocessing to linear regression modeling and result visualization.
Results: Detailed reports and visualizations comparing the original findings, our replication efforts, and the extended analysis with more recent data.
